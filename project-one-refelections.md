## Reflections

### Communication
Overall I think as a team, Phill and I had good communication. We would have regular meetings on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday where we would go over our work that we had done and what was still needed. We would also have a discussion on Thursday before we left where we would plan what we would do over the weekend.
We used various channels to communicate including, Teams, Github and through inperson meetings. We also would keep track of progress using our whiteboard at our station to keep track of tasks that still needed to be completed.
We were very good with our verbal communication in meetings and while working. We have a good relationship where we could easily ask and give help when needed.
Here is a picture of the progress of the whiteboard:

### Git
We had a few issues with git over the semester. Phill and I were working off the same repository and branch for the most part. This was because we were working on the same code at the same time. This cause issues as we would encounter merge conflicts if someone forgot to pull. As a result we became more careful when pushing and reminding each other when something had been changed.
We also had a problem with merging to the master branch. We were doing bug fixing on the gazePoint-Phill branch as we hadn’t merged the new keyboard over yet. This was causing conflicts when we tried to later merge the keyboard with the new bug fixes. In the end the code was different enough from the master branch we changed gazePoint-Phill to the master and renamed the old master branch.
I think what went wrong here is that both Phill and I are not very good at using github overall and hadn’t taken the time to get everything set up correctly at the start. The fact we had to work off the same branch also did not help.


### Peer Coding
A lot of the code we wrote on the gaze toolbar was peer coded. This was because we were working off the same file at the same time. Initially we were working on the keyboard in the same file. To avoid merge conflicts and to keep the code consistent, we found it easier to go over the code on one computer and use the other for research. This was actually beneficial in the long run because it allowed for me to get more familiar with the code before going straight in to writing it on my own.

We also used this when we were bug fixing. We were both quite unfamiliar with the code and had to search through it to fix bugs and problems so we would generally work together to find a solution and try different fixes. As we were at times changing code and were unsure of the result we would remove and change code on one computer and if it worked properly, then implement it on the other computer. This definiately became useful if code was deleted and we needed the original quickly. It also allowed us to try different solutions at the same time to see what was the most effiecient. This is also the reason there is an uneven amount of gommits to the git as my computer was mainly used as a testing one and we had Phill's computer implement the final fix.


### Documentation
I think over the semester, Phill and I have contributed some good documentation to the wiki. A lot of the code was not commented when I came in, so as I assisted working with the keyboard, I added comments that not only explain the code but also will be helpful for new students working on the project to understand the code and also get a better idea how the gaze interaction works.
I also contributed heavily to the wiki documentation for the user guide in preparation for the new release. We had removed and changed a lot of the functionality on the settings page and completely replaced the keyboard so the previous user guide was no longer relevant and had to be replaced. I also wrote an intro guide for new students on the project and a brief about our issues with the settings page.

### Settings page
The settings page was the main obstacle with the project. The person who made the form for the settings page did it in a weird way. This meant that every time we tried to remove something from the page or delete a component, random components and buttons would stop functioning or disappear off the page for no apparent reason. This made it hard to do any changes on the page. We ended up having to do everything programatically in the code or delete it through code instead of through the design page as any changes to that would break it. We also had no way of getting component names either withour moving panels. In the end we had to have one computer open with the settings page and move panels around to get names while Phill deleted them in the program and didn't touch his settings design page.

## External Engagement
### Volunteer Activities
I participated in three different volunteer activities over the semester.

* I also spent one and a half hours doing volunteer work at Literacy Aotearoa. I assisted in setting up a computer for them and other software such as their email client and office 360.
* Completed Volunteer work at age concern. From 1-3 I helped the elderly with their computer issues.
* 11-12.30 I attended volunteer work at the South Dunedin Pop-up library where I assisted the elderly with their computing issues.
Here is a picture of me doing volunteer work:

### Professional Development

* I attended the CodeCraft meet-up
* I worked as an assistant during the hour of code day on the 25th of May for techweek.

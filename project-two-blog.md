## Project Two

### Week One
I began taking stock of where the project was left off from last semester. I made a list of objectives for the next two weeks before meeting with David. The main ideas were:
* Researching strategies to raise awareness of the gazetoolbar.
* Finishing some left over code clean-up for the toolbar.
* Initial reasearch into adding environmental controls to the toolbar.

I created an new email address for the project and added the contact information to the accessibility software website. I also used the email address to create a new reddit account. I made a list of subreddits that I believe would be a good place to advertise the toolbar and saved them to the account to be approved of at a later date.
